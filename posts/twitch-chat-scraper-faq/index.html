    <p>Recently, a <a href="https://github.com/FireEater64/twitch-chat-scraper">side-project</a> I&rsquo;ve been working on to scrape Twitch chat logs has been causing quite a lot of confusion, both on Twitch and Twitter. I&rsquo;ll be doing a follow-up post detailing exactly what it is I&rsquo;ve been up to, but in this post, I&rsquo;ll attempt to summarise some of the most frequently asked questions, and my responses to them.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2>
<p>As my <a href="https://twitter.com/Fire_Eater64">Twitter</a> explains, I&rsquo;m a final-year Computer Science student at the <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>.</p>
<h1 id="why-are-you-in-every-channel-on-twitch">Why are you in every channel on Twitch?</h1>
<p>As a recent side-project I&rsquo;ve been writing a <a href="https://github.com/FireEater64/twitch-chat-scraper">Twitch chat scraper</a>, which connects to multiple Twitch chat channels - and stores any messages it sees in a database, for future analysis.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-doing-this">Why are you doing this?</h2>
<p>Mainly due to exam season boredom. I&rsquo;m also using this as an opportunity to learn a bit more about the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> programming language, as well as a personal curiosity about whether Twitch chat really is as mindless as its reputation would have you believe.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-you-doing-with-my-chat-messages">What are you doing with my chat messages?</h2>
<p>Currently, nothing. As mentioned above - I&rsquo;m currently in full-blown exam-panic mode at university, with little time to devote to this project. In the future, I&rsquo;d like to do some more analysis on the corpus of messages collected, largely inspired by the kind of thing Twitch&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/drewwww">Drew Harry</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OPqjDcXh5g">has done recently</a>. Some possible areas of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of emoticons/second for each channel</li>
<li>Chat sentiment (happy/sad etc.) during eSports events</li>
<li>Spectator behaviour (what percentage of chat is spammers, what kind of events inspire people to post in chat etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-are-you-hiding-it">Why are you hiding it?</h2>
<p>I in no way intend to hide what I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;ve become aware of the fact that what I&rsquo;m currently doing could definitely be more open. This is mainly due to the fact that I have limited time to work on the project, which is still very much a POC. Hopefully, this post goes some way to address people&rsquo;s (natural) curiosity - in the future I also plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a dedicated Twitch account for the scraper (something more obvious, like ChatCollector)</li>
<li>Make the bot respond to PMs - with a message directing them to this page.</li>
<li>Give channel owners an opt-out of data collection (more information below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="this-is-evil---please-stop">This is evil - please stop</h2>
<p>Firstly, I&rsquo;m sorry you think so. Doing something evil was never my intention. As far as I&rsquo;m aware - all the data I&rsquo;m collecting is posted in a public forum, is not against the <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/user/legal">Twitch TOS</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and is really no different to the hundreds of people and organisations <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/03/15/a-beginners-guide-to-collecting-twitter-data-and-a-bit-of-web-scraping/">scraping sites like Twitter every day</a>. If you disagree with this rationale, stick a comment down below/hit me up on Twitter.</p>
<p>If you do find this data collection intolerable, though, there are a couple of things you can do. Firstly, just ban me from your channel. I don&rsquo;t mind - seriously. In case you hadn&rsquo;t already guessed - I&rsquo;m much more of a chat spectator/lurker than a participant. Secondly, if banning doesn&rsquo;t work - I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/FireEater64/twitch-chat-scraper/issues/2">working on</a> a mechanism to blacklist certain channels if they&rsquo;ve indicated they want to opt-out of data collection. This is currently still a manual process - so anyone interested in being added to this list should contact me (either in the comments below, or via <a href="https://twitter.com/Fire_Eater64">Twitter</a>). At some point, this will be made self-serve - so channel owners can add themselves to the blacklist. For progress on this - see the <a href="https://github.com/FireEater64/twitch-chat-scraper/issues/2">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="give-me-technical-details">Give me technical details</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a full post at some point over the next week, with the technical details. In the meantime, feel free to check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/FireEater64/twitch-chat-scraper">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-remove-uniqbotsome-other-bot-from-my-channel">Can you remove UniqBot/Some other bot from my channel?</h2>
<p>Sadly not. The only username my scraper currently runs under is my own, &lsquo;fire_eater64&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s nothing to stop somebody else from building my project off GitHub, and running it themselves - or writing their own. In the case of bots/scrapers like &lsquo;UniqBot&rsquo; - you&rsquo;ll have to <a href="https://twitter.com/UniquePassive/status/695343645898076162">contact the person responsible for running it</a> in order to get it removed from your channel/answer any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Hopefully this has helped with some of the questions/concerns people have with what I&rsquo;m doing. If you have any questions/comments - feel free to stick them down below, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer them.</p>
